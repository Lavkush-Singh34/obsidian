    To free up space in your home directory, here are some targeted steps you can take:

### 1. **Clear Package Cache**
   - Pacman keeps a cache of all the downloaded packages, which can consume a lot of space. You can clear old packages with:
     ```bash
     sudo pacman -Sc
     ```
   - For a more aggressive cleanup (removing all cached packages), use:
     ```bash
     sudo pacman -Scc
     ```

### 2. **Remove AUR Build Files**
   - `yay` keeps a cache of AUR build files in your home directory (usually `~/.cache/yay/`). To clean it up, run:
     ```bash
     yay -Sc
     ```

### 3. **Clear Systemd Journal Logs**
   - System logs can pile up over time. You can limit them to free up space:
     ```bash
     sudo journalctl --vacuum-size=100M
     ```

### 4. **Find and Remove Large Files**
   - Use `du` to locate large files:
     ```bash
     du -h ~ | sort -rh | head -n 20
     ```
   - Delete any unnecessary large files from the list.

### 5. **Remove Unnecessary Packages and Orphans**
   - Remove orphaned packages (dependencies no longer needed by any installed package):
     ```bash
     sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qdtq)
     ```

### 6. **Clean up Temporary Files**
   - Clear temporary files in `/tmp`:
     ```bash
     sudo rm -rf /tmp/*
     ```

After doing some or all of these steps, your home directory should have more free space. Let me know if you need more specific advice!
