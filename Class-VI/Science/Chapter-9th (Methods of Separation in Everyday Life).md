### **1. What is handpicking, and when is it used?**

**Q:** Explain the method of handpicking and give an example of its use.  
**A:** Handpicking is a method used to separate solid materials from a mixture based on differences in size, color, or shape. It is suitable when the unwanted substances are present in small quantities and can be easily picked by hand.  
_Example:_ Removing small stones from rice or wheat grains.

### **2. What is threshing? How is it performed?**

**Q:** Describe threshing and its significance in agriculture.  
**A:** Threshing is the process of separating grains from stalks. It is performed by beating the stalks on a hard surface or using threshing machines. It is commonly used in agriculture to process harvested crops like wheat and rice.

### **3. How does winnowing work?**

**Q:** What is winnowing, and what components does it separate?  
**A:** Winnowing separates lighter components like husk from heavier grains using wind or blowing air. The lighter husk gets carried away, while the heavier grains fall closer to the source.

---

### **4. What is sieving, and where is it applied?**

**Q:** Define sieving and provide examples of its application.  
**A:** Sieving is a method of separating particles of different sizes by passing them through a sieve.  
_Example:_ Removing bran from wheat flour or separating pebbles from sand at construction sites.

---

### **5. Explain the process of sedimentation and decantation.**

**Q:** How do sedimentation and decantation help separate substances?  
**A:** Sedimentation involves heavier particles settling at the bottom of a liquid. Decantation is the process of gently pouring off the liquid to separate it from the settled solid.  
_Example:_ Separating muddy water into clean water and mud.

---

### **6. How does filtration differ from decantation?**

**Q:** What is filtration, and how is it different from decantation?  
**A:** Filtration separates insoluble solids from liquids using a filter medium, like filter paper, which traps the solid particles. Unlike decantation, filtration ensures a more thorough separation.  
_Example:_ Filtering tea to remove tea leaves.

---

### **7. What is evaporation, and how is it used in separation?**

**Q:** Describe the process of evaporation with an example.  
**A:** Evaporation converts a liquid into its vapor, leaving behind dissolved solids. It is commonly used to obtain salt from seawater by evaporating the water under the sun.

---

### **8. What is churning, and what is it used for?**

**Q:** How does churning help in separating substances?  
**A:** Churning separates lighter butter from heavier buttermilk by vigorously agitating curd. The lighter butter floats on top, and the buttermilk remains below.

---

### **9. What is magnetic separation?**

**Q:** Explain the method of magnetic separation and its uses.  
**A:** Magnetic separation involves using a magnet to separate magnetic materials from non-magnetic ones.  
_Example:_ Removing iron nails from sawdust.

---

### **10. Why is it important to separate substances in mixtures?**

**Q:** State two reasons why mixtures are separated.  
**A:**

1. To remove unwanted components (e.g., stones from grains).
2. To extract useful components (e.g., salt from seawater).

---

### **11. What are the benefits of using modern separation methods like threshers?**

**Q:** How have modern machines improved traditional methods like threshing?  
**A:** Modern threshers perform threshing and winnowing simultaneously, making the process faster and less labor-intensive.

---

### **12. How do natural processes like sedimentation relate to everyday life?**

**Q:** Provide an example of sedimentation from daily life.  
**A:** Washing rice before cooking involves sedimentation, where dirt and heavier particles settle at the bottom.

---

### **13. Why are sieves important in cooking and construction?**

**Q:** Mention two areas where sieving is commonly used.  
**A:**

1. In cooking, to remove bran or stones from flour.
2. In construction, to separate pebbles from sand.

---

### **14. What can we learn from the story of Malli and Valli’s journey?**

**Q:** How does the chapter integrate science with cultural exploration?  
**A:** The chapter uses Malli and Valli’s journey across India to teach scientific methods of separation while exploring regional practices and traditions, such as Dandi March and folk songs.
