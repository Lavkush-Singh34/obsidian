Important Questions and Answers:

Q1: What is the composition of air?
A: Air contains:
- 78% Nitrogen
- 21% Oxygen
- 1% Argon, carbon dioxide and other gases

Q2: What are renewable resources?
A: Resources that get renewed, replenished or restored within a reasonable period through natural processes (e.g., air, water, forests)

Q3: What are non-renewable resources?
A: Resources found in limited quantities that cannot be replenished within a reasonable time period (e.g., minerals, fossil fuels, coal)

Q4: How is soil formed?
A: Soil is formed by the disintegration of rocks through the actions of the Sun, water and living organisms over thousands of years.

Q5: What are fossil fuels and how are they formed?
A: Fossil fuels (petroleum, coal, natural gas) are formed from the remains of microorganisms and plants buried deep inside the earth over millions of years.
