### **Answers**

1. **Essential Characteristics of Living Beings:**
    
    - Movement
    - Need for food (nutrition)
    - Growth
    - Respiration
    - Excretion
    - Response to stimuli
    - Reproduction
    - Death
2. **Movement and Living Beings:**
    
    - Movement is not exclusive to living beings; for example, cars move but are non-living. True living beings exhibit growth, respiration, and reproduction along with movement.
3. **Movement in Drosera:**
    
    - Drosera (an insectivorous plant) has saucer-shaped leaves with sticky hair-like projections. When an insect lands on it, the hairs move inward to trap the insect.
4. **Role of Water in Seed Germination:**
    
    - Water softens the seed coat, enabling the embryo inside to grow. It is vital for metabolic activities necessary for germination.
5. **Life Cycle of a Mosquito:**
    
    - Stage I: Egg
    - Stage II: Larva
    - Stage III: Pupa
    - Stage IV: Adult mosquito
    - The cycle starts with eggs laid in water, which hatch into larvae, transform into pupae, and finally emerge as adult mosquitoes.
6. **Life Cycle of a Frog:**
    
    - **Stage I:** Spawn (Eggs)
    - **Stage II:** Embryo
    - **Stage III:** Tadpole (first with a tail, then with hind legs)
    - **Stage IV:** Froglet
    - **Stage V:** Adult frog
    - The frog undergoes significant changes, including habitat transition from water to both land and water.
7. **Conditions for Seed Germination:**
    
    - Seeds require the right amount of water, air, and temperature. Water facilitates metabolic activities, air provides oxygen for respiration, and light/dark conditions influence growth post-germination.
8. **Differences Between Plant and Animal Life Cycles:**
    
    - **Plants:** Begin with seed germination, grow, flower, and produce seeds that give rise to new plants.
    - **Animals:** Start as newborns, grow into adults, and reproduce to maintain the continuity of the species. Animals show more dynamic mobility compared to plants.
