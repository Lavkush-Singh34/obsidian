**Chapter 7: Heat and Temperature (Summary, Key Topics, and Important Questions)**

---

### **Summary**  
This chapter explains the concepts of temperature, the difference between hot and cold objects, and how temperature is measured using different instruments called thermometers. It covers the types of thermometers, their scales, and their specific uses.

### **Key Topics**  

1. **Temperature:**  
   - It defines how hot or cold an object is.  
   - **SI Unit:** Kelvin (K). Other common scales: Celsius (Â°C) and Fahrenheit (Â°F).  

2. **Types of Thermometers:**  
   - **Clinical Thermometer:** Used to measure body temperature. Normal body temperature: 37.0 Â°C (98.6 Â°F).  
   - **Laboratory Thermometer:** Used to measure the temperature of substances. Range: -10 Â°C to 110 Â°C.  
   - **Room Thermometer:** Used to measure the atmospheric temperature.  

3. **Temperature Scales:**  
   - **Celsius Scale:** 0 Â°C = freezing point of water, 100 Â°C = boiling point of water.  
   - **Fahrenheit Scale:** 32 Â°F = freezing point of water, 212 Â°F = boiling point of water.  
   - **Kelvin Scale:** 0 K = absolute zero (lowest possible temperature).  

4. **Precautions while Measuring Temperature:**  
   - Clean the thermometer before and after use.  
   - Use the correct type of thermometer for specific measurements.  
   - Ensure the thermometer bulb does not touch the container's surface during measurements.  

5. **Activities to Understand Heat and Temperature:**  
   - Touching hot and cold water to compare sensations.  
   - Using laboratory thermometers to measure the temperature of boiling water and ice.

### **Important Questions (with Answers):**

1. **Question:** What is the SI unit of temperature?  
   **Answer:** The SI unit of temperature is Kelvin (K).  

2. **Question:** What is the normal range of a clinical thermometer?  
   **Answer:** 35 Â°C to 42 Â°C.  

3. **Question:** What is the Fahrenheit equivalent of 37 Â°C?  
   **Answer:** 98.6 Â°F.  

4. **Question:** Why is a laboratory thermometer not suitable for measuring body temperature?  
   **Answer:** Its bulb is larger, and the range does not match the human body temperature range.  

5. **Question:** Write the relationship between Kelvin and Celsius scales.  
   **Answer:** K = Â°C + 273.15.  

6. **Question:** Should the bulb of a thermometer be fully immersed in a substance for accurate measurement?  
   **Answer:** Yes, for accurate readings.

### **Teaching Tips:**  
1. **Use Real-Life Examples:**  
   - Demonstrate using different thermometers for various purposes.  
   - Explain why temperature is essential in daily life (e.g., weather, health).  

2. **Hands-On Experiments:**  
   - Allow students to measure their body temperatures with clinical thermometers.  
   - Conduct activities to compare temperatures of hot and cold water using laboratory thermometers.  

3. **Interactive Questions:**  
   - Ask students why metals feel colder than wood at room temperature.  
   - Discuss the impact of temperature on weather and health.  

4. **Encourage Note-Making:**  
   - Ask students to draw thermometer diagrams and label the parts.  
   - Guide them to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

**Activity Ideas for Students:**  
- Measure the temperature of hot and cold water using a thermometer and record their observations.  
- Compare the body temperature of classmates and identify variations.  
- Research the average temperature of different animals and prepare a table.
