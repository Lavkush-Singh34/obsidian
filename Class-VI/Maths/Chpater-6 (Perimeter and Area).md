### **Key Formulas**

#### **1. Perimeter**

- **Rectangle**:  
  $$P_{\text{rectangle}} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{breadth})$$

- **Square**:  
  $$P_{\text{square}} = 4 \times \text{side}$$

- **Triangle**:  
  $$P_{\text{triangle}} = \text{Sum of the lengths of all three sides}$$

- **Regular Polygon**:  
  $$P_{\text{polygon}} = \text{Number of sides} \times \text{Length of one side}$$

#### **2. Area**

- **Rectangle**:  
  $$A_{\text{rectangle}} = \text{length} \times \text{breadth}$$

- **Square**:  
  $$A_{\text{square}} = \text{side}^2$$

- **Triangle**:  
  $$A_{\text{triangle}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$$

#### **Key Concepts**

1. **Relation Between Perimeter and Area:**
    
    - Figures with the same perimeter can have different areas.
    - Figures with the same area can have different perimeters.
2. **Applications:**
    
    - Fencing: Calculate perimeter for the length of fencing material.
    - Carpet/Flooring: Use area to determine the material required.
3. **Estimating Area:**
    
    - Use graph paper for irregular shapes.
    - Count squares (full square = 1 unit, half square = 0.5 unit).

### **Key Formulas with Definitions**

#### **1. Perimeter**

- **Definition**:  
  The perimeter is the total length of the boundary of a closed figure.

- **Rectangle**:  
  $$P_{\text{rectangle}} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{breadth})$$  
  The perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of its length and breadth.

- **Square**:  
  $$P_{\text{square}} = 4 \times \text{side}$$  
  The perimeter of a square is four times the length of one of its sides.

- **Triangle**:  
  $$P_{\text{triangle}} = \text{Sum of the lengths of all three sides}$$  
  The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides.

- **Regular Polygon**:  
  $$P_{\text{polygon}} = \text{Number of sides} \times \text{Length of one side}$$  
  The perimeter of a regular polygon is the number of sides multiplied by the length of one side.

#### **2. Area**

- **Definition**:  
  The area is the measure of the surface enclosed within the boundary of a closed figure.

- **Rectangle**:  
  $$A_{\text{rectangle}} = \text{length} \times \text{breadth}$$  
  The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and breadth.

- **Square**:  
  $$A_{\text{square}} = \text{side}^2$$  
  The area of a square is the square of the length of one of its sides.

- **Triangle**:  
  $$A_{\text{triangle}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$$  
  The area of a triangle is half the product of its base and height.
